# Episode One | A Basic Expression Evaluator
## My Notes

Video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHIkdUQbp0&list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y).

The parser deals with WORDS.
- First part is LEXER, which creates words
- Second part is parser, which forms SENTENCES

We'll start with a Lexer class to turn code into "words"

## Lexer and Syntax Tokens
- A syntax token is kind of like a word

## Beginning the Parser
- The lexer produces tokens
	- "Leaves"
- The parser produces "sentences" using the tokens
	 - Trees of leaves
